Course Description: Introduction to science and art of map production; principles of thematic map compilation and design; history of thematic mapping; map projections; data management and symbolization; common types and styles of thematic maps.

Notes: Likely most significant single course in major in terms of examining the outward interaction of the results of GIS work and people outside the field that need to use it. Emphasis was put on the fact that maps are not just data and images to display, but are made for people of all walks to read, and that information density and function needs to be balanced properly with visual deign, intuitive representation, adn form. "Science *and art* of map production is the key phrase for a reason.
